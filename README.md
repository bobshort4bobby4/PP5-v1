Keywords placed in semantic elements were given higher priority as search engines give these elements greater weight.  The alt text for all the images on the stock page was changed to give each car a description of its make and model and a used or new classifacation.  
The social links were given the rel="noopener" attribute to ensure their content was ignored by search engines.  
A link to SIMI was provided to further boost rankings.
