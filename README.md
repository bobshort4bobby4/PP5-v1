* SEO

Potential customers needs: Value, good range of vehicles to choose from, Reputation of seller, after-sales service

Look at other websites serving the same market see what is good and question if it would be appropriate to implement similiar features on your website.


Initial list of keywords

carsales, value cars, used cars, cheap cars, trade-in, second-hand vehicles, local garage, local car sales, Motordealers, cardealers, car finance, quality used cars, quality second hand vehicles, hybrid used cars, used electric vehicles, best garage near me, guaranteed used vehicles, guaranteed cars.

The 10  best of these were selected based on relevance, authority and volume to the following short-tail and longtail phrases. the website wordtracker was used in this selection process

- used cars dublin
- used cars Ireland
- cars for sale
- second hand cars
- best place to buy used cars near me
- best place to buy new cars near me
- car dealers near me
- cheap used cars near me
- used hybrid cars
- used electric vehicles

The next step in SEO optimisation was to include as many as possible of the keywords into the text of the website. This was done to ensure the language was still relevant and natural. Keywords placed in semantic elements were given higher priority as search engines give these elements greater weight.  The alt text for all the images on the stock page was changed to give each car a description of its make and model and a used or new classifacation.  
The social links were given the rel="noopener" attribute to ensure their content was ignored by search engines.  
A link to SIMI was provided to further boost rankings.
The meta data tags were created in the html head.

* Marketing 

It is planned that the main methods of marketing the business will be through SEO optimisation, via  organic social media marketing, principally Facebook and a weekly email newsletter.
The reasons these methods were choosen was largely due to budget constraints.
Whilst there is plenty of scope for content marketing such as articles/guides to buying vehicles, maintainance tips,  weekly video's of new stock, a valuer for trade-in vehicles (api), there are insufficent resources available currently to implement.
Paid adds for social media sites and search engines were not considered at this stage due to the cost/value.
