   ### EPICS
   
   Using the user stories as a frame of reference the following Epics were formulated;
  
  - Epic 01 implement basic html and django structure.
  - Epic 02 implement user registration and login.
  - Epic 03 implement stock display and search system.
  - Epic 04 implement order system.
  - Epic 05 implement purchase system using Stripe.
  - Epic 06 implement User profile system.
  - Epic 07 implement Seo and web-marketing.
  - Epic 08 implement staff admin functions.
  - Epic 09 implement trade-in function.
  
   
  The user stories were prioritised using the MoSCoW technique and the Kanban Board feature built-in to Github will be used as an information radiator.
  The user stories were broken down into tasks and these were listed under their respective issue in the initial Kanban Board.  
  The acceptance criteria for each user story are listed in each issue in the github project board.
  Care was taken to ensure should-have prioritised user stories are not greater than 60% of the total.  
    
  An image of the first issue is shown below for illustrative purposes.

# Search Engine Optimization

<details>

<summary> Search Engine Optimization</summary>
  
    
    

Ensuring the site ranks highly on search engines results is vital to the success of  most ecommerce businesses. Seo is a low cost method of marketing and is very effective at directing potential customers to the site.

#### Keyword Research
  
 I considered what topics our potential users most care about and using these created a list of potential keywords as follows;
    
 carsales, value cars, used cars, cheap cars, trade-in, second-hand vehicles, local garage, local car sales, Motordealers, cardealers, car finance, quality used cars, quality second hand vehicles, hybrid used cars, used electric vehicles, best garage near me, guaranteed used vehicles, guaranteed cars.  
   
The 10  best of these were selected based on relevance, authority and volume to the following short-tail and longtail phrases. the website wordtracker was used in this selection process

- used cars dublin
- used cars Ireland
- cars for sale
- second hand cars
- best place to buy used cars near me
- best place to buy new cars near me
- car dealers near me
- cheap used cars near me
- used hybrid cars
- used electric vehicles  
  
    
The next step in SEO optimisation was to include as many as possible of the keywords into the text of the website. This was done to ensure the language was still relevant and natural. Keywords placed in semantic elements were given higher priority as search engines give these elements greater weight.  

As resources allow it is planned to add articles and blog entries which will enhance the websites authority on our area of business, this should boost our ranking further.  A website that displays authority, expertise and trustworthiness will rank highly in search engine results, this metric is more important now that pure keyword matching. Relevant articles should also reduce bounce rate and increase session time.

The alt text for all the images on the stock page was changed to give each car a description of its make and model and a used or new classifacation.    

The social links were given the rel="noopener" attribute to ensure their content was ignored by search engines.    

A link to SIMI was provided to further boost rankings.  

The meta data tags were created in the html head.    

A sitemap.xml file was created using the xml-sitemaps.com website and placed in the root directory of the project.  The sitemap file helps search engines to access and analyse the website. It has not been registered with Google as per requirements for this project.  
  
A robots.txt file was created and saved in the root directory. This file specifies which search engines are allowed to crawl the site and which parts should be accessible.  
  
A link is provided to the websites privacy policy to aid transparency and build trust with users.  
The privacy policy was generated using [privacypolicygenerator.info](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/)

# Web Marketing

<details>

<summary>Web Marketing</summary>  
  
  
The site is a business to customer model. It will sell new and used vehicles directly to the end-user.  

It is planned that the main methods of marketing the business will be through SEO, via  organic social media marketing, principally Facebook and a weekly email newsletter.  

The reasons these methods were choosen was largely due to budget constraints.
Whilst there is plenty of scope for content marketing such as articles/guides to buying vehicles, maintainance tips,  weekly video's of new stock, a valuer for trade-in vehicles (api), there are insufficent resources available currently to implement all of these.    
  
Similar websites serving the same market will be looked at and features that are considered to work well will be implemented as a first step.  

Paid adds for social media sites and search engines were not considered at this stage due to the cost/value.  

The Facebook page is linked from the site and is also shown below. The Mailchimp app is used to facilitate the newsletter.

 ### Responsive Testing
  
  The website was tested for responsiveness using the built-in tool in the Google Chrome browser. As I worked through each breakpoint I fixed any display issues I encountered.  
  A set of images of the homepage at each breakpoint is shown.
